negative,@AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
negative,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.

neutral,@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
negative,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
negative,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.

negative,@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
neutral,"@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book"
negative,@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
negative,@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
negative,@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???

positive,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
negative,@AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help
negative,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
negative,@AmericanAir I need refund.
neutral,@united I already did.
positive,@USAirways thank you
negative,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"

negative,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
negative,@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
